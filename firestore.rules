/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the JanSetu Application.
 *
 * @description
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements an NGO-based access control model. A user's
 * permissions are determined by their role and their affiliation with a specific NGO,
 * as defined in their user profile document. Access to sensitive data, such as
 * beneficiaries, is scoped to the NGO they belong to.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /ngos/{ngoId}: Top-level public information about NGOs.
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profiles containing critical authorization data
 *   like their role and assigned `ngoId`.
 * - /ngos/{ngoId}/beneficiaries/{beneficiaryId}: Beneficiary data, nested under the
 *   NGO they are associated with for clear, secure, and performant access control.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users can only access their own profile document (/users/{userId}).
 *   Listing all users is strictly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - NGO-Scoped Access: Access to beneficiary data within `/ngos/{ngoId}/...` is granted
 *   only to users whose profile document contains a matching `ngoId`. This is checked
 *   via a `get()` call to the user's profile on every relevant request.
 * - Read-Only NGOs: The management (creation, update, deletion) of NGO documents is not
 *   defined in the current requirements. Therefore, all write operations on `/ngos` are
 *   denied by default as a security measure, while reads are allowed for signed-in users.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: These rules enforce strict authorization but do not
 *   validate the shape or data types of documents, allowing for rapid front-end
 *   development and iteration on the data model.
